# Content Strategy Simulator

This interactive tool is designed to help students and professionals alike dive into the world of content strategy, budget allocation, and performance metrics. By simulating real-world decision-making scenarios for Canva's marketing efforts, users can gain hands-on experience in strategic planning and analysis.

## Project Purpose

The Content Strategy Simulator aims to:

1. Provide a practical, risk-free environment for experimenting with content strategy decisions.
2. Teach budget allocation across different channels and audience segments.
3. Demonstrate the impact of strategic choices on key performance indicators (KPIs).
4. Foster critical thinking and data-driven decision-making skills.

## How It Works

Users can create multiple content strategies, allocating budgets to various channels and targeting different audience segments. The simulator then calculates estimated impressions, conversions, and conversion rates based on predefined weights for each channel and audience.

## Channel and Audience Weights
